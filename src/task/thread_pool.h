/*
This header-only C++11 package provides mt::thread_pool which
assigns incoming tasks to a fixed number of threads.

Following methods are supported:

* thread_pool()
construct thread pool with n threads where
n = std::thread::hardware_concurrency()

* thread_pool(unsigned int nofthreads)
construct thread pool with the given number of threads

* ~thread_pool()
the destructor waits for all threads to finish

* unsigned int size()
return the number of threads

* void join()
wait for all threads to finish

* void terminate()
request a speedy termination, i.e. submitted but not yet assigned
tasks remain undone; threads that wait for the corresponding futures
will see broken promises

* std::future<T> submit(F task_function, parameters...)
submit a task which is to be executed by one of the threads
of the pool; the future objects allows to synchronize with
the completion of the task and to receive the return value
of the submitted task; the future object will be possibly tied
to a broken promise if join() has already been called or
terminate() is invoked before the task has started
